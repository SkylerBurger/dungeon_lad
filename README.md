## Cogs

Cogs are Python classes that can be separately loaded into the bot. Each Cog contains related functionality in the form of commands.

### CypherSystem

A Cog built with commands to assist games powered by the [Cypher System](http://cypher-system.com/what-is-the-cypher-system/) engine.

#### /cy

Calculates the success level of a cypher system task.

The command is formed by typing `/cy` followed by any additional argument pairs. An argument pair is the resource name (effort, asset, assets, bonus, bonuses, shift, shifts) followed by the number representing the amount of that resource that is being applied. The argument pairs can be entered in any order and are completely optional.

```
# Command Template:
/cy effort <int> asset(s) <int> bonus(es) <int> shift(s) <int>

# Command Examples:
/cy
/cy bonus 1
/cy shift 1 assets 2
/cy bonuses 1 asset 1 effort 2 shifts 1
```

### Utilities

A Cog built with general-purpose commands.

#### /name

Manages characters names for players. Character names are used in place of usernames in messages generated by the bot if a player registers their character's name.

```
# Command Templates:
/name - Will report back your character name, if one is registered.
/name <character_name> - Will assign <character_name> to your account.

# Command Examples:
/name Rune Amon  # Will set my name to 'Rune Amon'
/name  # Will report back that my current character name is 'Rune Amon'
```

#### /noname

Deregisters a character name associated with the player issuing the command.

```
# Command Template:
/noname

# Command Example:
/ noname  # That's it! Any associated character name will be removed.
```
